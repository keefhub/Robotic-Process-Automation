# Robotic-Process-Automation
I was first introduced to RPA (Robotic Process Automation) during my internship. So what is a RPA?
RPA is a software automation program that help users to automate mundane processes. This could potentially save many hours of work and reduce the workload of the user.
However, during my internship, what I encountered is a slow server. So the challenges I faced were more than just configuration of the program but, also the probability of server timeout error. 
The internship company uses "UiBot" for the making of RPA. Sadly, this software lacks detailed English documentation online as it is a Chinese-based software company. In this repository, I will document my RPA journey - thought process and the challenges I faced.
